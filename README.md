Hi All!

This is a personal project I created December 2023 which contains a JavaFX project.
What it does is allows a user to create a dental receipt based on the services they consumed.
There is also a login page (username: Adam Zielinski, password: 123) to access the billing system.
If you get the credentials wrong it will not give you access.

Here are some snapshots:
